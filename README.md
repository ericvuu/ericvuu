## About Me

Hello, I'm Eric. ü§òüèº

I'm a Software Engineer from Orange County, CA.

My career has been shaped by a diverse set of experiences across the nonprofit, legal, and tech industries, each of which has strengthened my ability to solve problems and drive results.

I started in the nonprofit sector, where I worked as a Food Sourcing Coordinator at Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County. In this role, I led initiatives that used data-driven strategies to increase food donations, helping to support individuals and families facing homelessness.

Next, I transitioned into the legal field, managing the Orange County Bar Association‚Äôs Mandatory Fee Arbitration Program under the guidance of the California State Bar. I oversaw key administrative functions, such as data management, document preparation, and coordination of legal communications, ensuring smooth case logistics and attention to detail.

Motivated to pursue a career in technology, I made the shift to web and software development, where I gained proficiency in Python, Java, and the MERN stack through coding workshops. This allowed me to combine my problem-solving abilities with a deeper technical skill set.

Today, I focus on writing efficient, reusable code and building applications that prioritize user experience. I‚Äôm passionate about using my diverse background to create innovative solutions that make a real impact.
